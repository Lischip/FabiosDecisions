	abstract = {There is a growing interest in model-based decision support under deep uncertainty, reﬂected in a variety of approaches being put forward in the literature. A key idea shared among these is the use of models for exploratory rather than predictive purposes. Exploratory modeling aims at exploring the implications for decision making of the various presently irresolvable uncertainties. This is achieved by conducting series of computational experiments that cover how the various uncertainties might resolve. This paper presents an open source library supporting this. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench is implemented in Python. It is designed to (i) support the generation and execution of series of computational experiments; and (ii) support the visualization and analysis of the results from the computational experiments. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench enables users to easily perform exploratory modeling with existing models, identify the policy-relevant uncertainties, assess the efﬁcacy of policy options, and iteratively improve candidate strategies.},

	shorttitle = {Accounting for the uncertain effects of hydraulic interactions in optimising embankments heights},
	abstract = {Most alluvial plains in the world are protected by flood defences, for example, embankments, whose primary aim is to reduce the probability of flooding of the protected areas. At the same time, however, the presence of embankments at one area influences hydraulic conditions of downstream areas located on the same river. These hydraulic interactions are often neglected in current flood risk management. The aim of this study is to explicitly acknowledge hydraulic interactions and investigate their impact on establishing optimal embankment heights along a stretch of the {IJssel} River. We find that the current approach leads to a single solution, while taking into account hydraulic interactions substantially expands the number of promising solutions. Furthermore, under a reference scenario, the current approach is in fact suboptimal with respect to both downstream locations and the system as a whole. Under uncertainty, it performs adequately from a system viewpoint, but poorly for individual locations, mostly due to risk overestimation downstream. Overall, the current approach proves to be too short-sighted, because spatial trade-offs among locations are neglected and alternative solutions remain hidden. Acknowledging the effect of hydraulic interactions provides policy makers with a broader and more comprehensive spectrum of flood risk management strategies.},
