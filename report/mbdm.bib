	abstract = {Most alluvial plains in the world are protected by flood defences, for example, embankments, whose primary aim is to reduce the probability of flooding of the protected areas. At the same time, however, the presence of embankments at one area influences hydraulic conditions of downstream areas located on the same river. These hydraulic interactions are often neglected in current flood risk management. The aim of this study is to explicitly acknowledge hydraulic interactions and investigate their impact on establishing optimal embankment heights along a stretch of the {IJssel} River. We find that the current approach leads to a single solution, while taking into account hydraulic interactions substantially expands the number of promising solutions. Furthermore, under a reference scenario, the current approach is in fact suboptimal with respect to both downstream locations and the system as a whole. Under uncertainty, it performs adequately from a system viewpoint, but poorly for individual locations, mostly due to risk overestimation downstream. Overall, the current approach proves to be too short-sighted, because spatial trade-offs among locations are neglected and alternative solutions remain hidden. Acknowledging the effect of hydraulic interactions provides policy makers with a broader and more comprehensive spectrum of flood risk management strategies.},

A key idea shared among these is the use of models for exploratory rather than predictive purposes. Exploratory modeling aims at exploring the implications for decision making of the various presently irresolvable uncertainties. This is achieved by conducting series of computational experiments that cover how the various uncertainties might resolve. This paper presents an open source library supporting this. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench is implemented in Python. It is designed to (i) support the generation and execution of series of computational experiments; and (ii) support the visualization and analysis of the results from the computational experiments. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench enables users to easily perform exploratory modeling with existing models, identify the policy-relevant uncertainties, assess the efﬁcacy of policy options, and iteratively improve candidate strategies.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes the discursive strategies surrounding the implementation of the Dutch water safety program ‘Room for the River’. When this program was announced, it was heralded as a paradigm shift fitting in with the ongoing transition to ‘living with water’. Yet announcing a paradigm shift is not the real thing. When a policy is made, it is still a dead letter. For it to become implemented, people have to act on it as if it is a reality. It needs to be socially produced – and reproduced. The present article looks at how the new river policy initiative is ‘translated’ to the local level, how discourse coalitions ‘pro’ and ‘contra’ develop and how they discursively defend their claims. In this ‘translation process’ elements of the original policy narrative are selected and reinterpreted to fit into the specific purposes of local stakeholders. While its protagonists have been active in promoting the program as a successful ‘paradigm shift’, others have questioned this claim. This contribution inventories the different narratives of success and failure on Room for the River, by homing in on an indicative case study. We show how elements of the official policy narrative are used, broadened, questioned or reinterpreted by local actors to defend their specific point of view. Their narratives try to weld discursive alliances between catchy rhetorical devices, normative values and sources of expertise. They make selective use of the dominant narrative of current river management speak, and ‘shop’ between scientific and policy venues to support these claims.

Points for practitioners
Policy ideas and labels are inevitably translated and modified as they ‘land’ in the local arena. A ‘success’ label may influence but cannot determine local acceptance and implementation of a policy. Locally, labels are likely to become tangled with other labels and interpretations. Multi-objective policies prove particularly vulnerable to criticism from ‘purist’ and one-issue opponents. Project managers should anticipate the dynamics of reframing and be able to adjust that discourse and labeling where necessary lest they become burdens.},

To deal with these uncertainties, dynamic adaptive policies that can be changed over time are suggested. This paper presents a model-driven approach supporting the development of promising adaptation pathways, and illustrates the approach using a hypothetical case. We use robust optimization over uncertainties related to climate change, land use, cause-effect relations, and policy efficacy, to identify the most promising pathways. For this purpose, we generate an ensemble of possible futures and evaluate candidate pathways over this ensemble using an Integrated Assessment Meta Model. We understand ‘most promising’ in terms of the robustness of the performance of the candidate pathways on multiple objectives, and use a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find the set of most promising pathways. This results in an adaptation map showing the set of most promising adaptation pathways and options for transferring from one pathway to another. Given the pathways and signposts, decision-makers can make an informed decision on a dynamic adaptive plan in a changing environment that is able to achieve their intended objectives despite the myriad of uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Managing water resources systems requires coordinated operation of system infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of hydrologic extremes while balancing conflicting multisectoral demands. Traditionally, recommended management strategies are derived by optimizing system operations under a single problem framing that is assumed to accurately represent the system objectives, tacitly ignoring the myriad of effects that could arise from simplifications and mathematical assumptions made when formulating the problem. This study illustrates the benefits of a rival framings framework in which analysts instead interrogate multiple competing hypotheses of how complex water management problems should be formulated. Analyzing rival framings helps discover unintended consequences resulting from inherent biases of alternative problem formulations. We illustrate this on the monsoonal Red River basin in Vietnam by optimizing operations of the system's four largest reservoirs under several different multiobjective problem framings. In each rival framing, we specify different quantitative representations of the system's objectives related to hydropower production, agricultural water supply, and flood protection of the capital city of Hanoi. We find that some formulations result in counterintuitive behavior. In particular, policies designed to minimize expected flood damages inadvertently increase the risk of catastrophic flood events in favor of hydropower production, while min-max objectives commonly used in robust optimization provide poor representations of system tradeoffs due to their instability. This study highlights the importance of carefully formulating and evaluating alternative mathematical abstractions of stakeholder objectives describing the multisectoral water demands and risks associated with hydrologic extremes.},

In its original inception, the search phase identifies optimal strategies for a single reference scenario for deep uncertainties, which may result in missing locally near-optimal, but globally more robust strategies. Recent work has addressed this issue by generating candidate strategies for multiple policy-relevant scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate a systematic scenario selection procedure in the search phase to consider both policy relevance and scenario diversity. The results demonstrate an increased tradeoff variety besides higher robustness, compared to the solutions found for a reference scenario.

Recent studies have shown that the application of different robustness metrics can result in different rankings of decision alternatives, but there has been little discussion of what potential causes for this might be. To shed some light on this issue, we present a unifying framework for the calculation of robustness metrics, which assists with understanding how robustness metrics work, when they should be used, and why they sometimes disagree. The framework categorizes the suitability of metrics to a decision-maker based on (1) the decision-context (i.e., the suitability of using absolute performance or regret), (2) the decision-maker's preferred level of risk aversion, and (3) the decision-maker's preference toward maximizing performance, minimizing variance, or some higher-order moment. This article also introduces a conceptual framework describing when relative robustness values of decision alternatives obtained using different metrics are likely to agree and disagree. This is used as a measure of how “stable” the ranking of decision alternatives is when determined using different robustness metrics. The framework is tested on three case studies, including water supply augmentation in Adelaide, Australia, the operation of a multipurpose regulated lake in Italy, and flood protection for a hypothetical river based on a reach of the river Rhine in the Netherlands. The proposed conceptual framework is confirmed by the case study results, providing insight into the reasons for disagreements between rankings obtained using different robustness metrics.},

The more robustness is considered in the search phase, the more robust solutions are also after re-evaluation but also the lower the performance in individual reference scenarios. Adaptive policy formulations positively affect robustness, but do not reduce the price for robustness.

Traditional strategies for solving multiobjective water resources problems typically aggregate multiple performance measures into single composite objectives (e.g., a priori preference weighting or grouping-like measures by category). Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem, commonly referred to as Arrow’s Paradox, implies that a subset of performance concerns will inadvertently dictate the properties of the optimized design alternative in unpredictable ways when using aggregated objectives. This study shows how many-objective planning can aid in battling Arrow’s Paradox. Many-objective planning explicitly disaggregates measures of performance while supporting the discovery of planning tradeoffs, using tools such as multiobjective evolutionary algorithms ({MOEAs}). An urban water portfolio planning case study for the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas is used to demonstrate how aggregate, lower objective-count formulations can adversely bias risk-based decision support. Additionally, this study employs a comprehensive diagnostic assessment of the Borg {MOEA}’s ability to address Arrow’s Paradox by enabling users to explore problem formulations with increasing numbers of objectives and decisions. Counter to conventional assumptions, the diagnostic analysis carefully documents that for modern self-adaptive {MOEA} searches, increasing objective counts can lead to more effective, efficient, reliable, and controllable searches. The increased objective counts are also shown to directly reduce decision biases that can emerge from problem formulation aggregation and simplification, related to Arrow’s Paradox.},

However, no systematic, general approach exists for finding robust strategies using the broad range of models and data often available to decision makers. This study demonstrates robust decision making ({RDM}), an analytic method that helps design robust strategies through an iterative process that first suggests candidate robust strategies, identifies clusters of future states of the world to which they are vulnerable, and then evaluates the trade-offs in hedging against these vulnerabilities. This approach can help decision makers design robust strategies while also systematically generating clusters of key futures interpretable as narrative scenarios. Our study demonstrates the approach by identifying robust, adaptive, near-term pollution-control strategies to help ensure economic growth and environmental quality throughout the 21st century.},

	abstract = {Water systems planning and management share the same roots with gaming, as they rely on concepts in systems analysis, operations research and decision sciences. This paper focuses on Serious Games (those used for purposes other than mere entertainment), with applications in the area of water systems planning and management. A survey of published work on gaming is carried out with particular attention given to applications of Serious Gaming to water systems planning and management. The survey is also used to identify the principal criteria for the classification of Serious Gaming for water related applications, including application areas, goals, number and type of players, user interface, type of simulation model used, realism of the game, performance feedback, progress monitoring and game portability. The review shows that game applications in the water sector can be a valuable tool for making various stakeholders aware of the socio-techno-economic issues related to managing complex water systems. However, the critical review also indicates a gap that exists in the Serious Game application area with the lack of water distribution system games. A conceptually simple, but computationally elaborate new game for water distribution system analysis, design and evaluation ({SeGWADE}) is presented in this paper. It has a main goal of finding a least-cost design for a well-known benchmark problem, for which the game environment takes the computational and visualisation burden away from the simulation tool and the player. The game has been evaluated in a classroom environment in which a high degree of player engagement with the game was observed, due to its basic game ingredients and activities, i.e., challenge, play and fun. In addition, a clear improvement in learning has been observed in how players attempted to identify solutions that satisfy the pressure criterion with players readily identifying the proximity of the better solutions to the starting, infeasible configuration. Through applications of Serious Gaming such as this, decision makers can learn about the complexity of the water distribution system design problem, experiment safely using a computer model of a real system, understand conflicting objectives (i.e., minimization of cost and satisfaction of minimum pressure) and develop strategies for coping with complexity without being burdened by the limitations of the {ICT} technology at their disposal.},

We conclude that Room for the River plays an important role in a transition to integrated river basin management in the Netherlands through practical implementation of the strategic policy vision for integrated water management. Also, through application of a mixed centralized–decentralized governance approach, the programme has tackled governance pitfalls related to centralized planning approaches that previously impeded integrated water management. Although several of the governance lessons of the programme are being adopted by, for example, the Delta Programme, we have identified a risk that continuity of the newly introduced governance approach may be lost when the Room for the River programme is completed in 2015.},

This is problematic because the potential of science to enrich decision-making is underexploited.

Science-policy interfaces ({SPIs}), such as knowledge brokers, are suggested to enhance science-policy interactions by promoting the production of credible, salient and legitimate knowledge. However, the current scientific debate provides little clarity on which {SPIs} are most useful in solving which science-policy interaction problems and what strategies should be employed. Based on a profound literature review, this paper aims to arrive at a better understanding of {SPIs}, by providing conceptual clarity and linking typical {SPIs} to distinct problems and the contexts in which they emerge.

The proliferation of infrastructure improvements has become palpable, hence the necessity to address information asymmetry in the public sector. The reliance on the private sector for expertise and knowledge has exacerbated the information asymmetry gap. A systematic literature review was done on 102 articles using words such as public value, return on government investments, public-private partnerships governance and public accountability, risk management, risk-sharing, and information asymmetry. Content analysis with the use of {ATLAS}/{TI} an automated tool was used to analyse the 102 articles that were published in management journals, conference proceedings, and books. The struggle faced by the public sector to overcome information asymmetry was discussed and described. The findings indicated that there is a specific gap in the literature relating to information asymmetry, regarding information and communication technology service delivery using {PPP} contracts. The contribution of this paper provides literature on information asymmetry and the management of {PPP} contracts. The employment of skilled information technology professionals in the public sector could eliminate the dependency on private sector resources, thereby minimising the risk of information asymmetry.},

Information asymmetry often stems from inadequate information sharing and can result in negative consequences for both the information poor and the information rich. Information asymmetry has been insufficiently studied as a possible cause of underdevelopment and inequality. In response, we develop a typology to classify information asymmetry into two categories, horizontal and vertical, and then identify those information sharing practices that cause the imbalance. To illustrate the negative consequences of information asymmetry and the potential benefits of information sharing, we discuss two examples from the experiences of modern American Indian tribes. First, Indian tribes face horizontal information asymmetry when they attempt to access the capital markets, and second, they face vertical information asymmetry in terms of law enforcement data sharing. This article also describes our ongoing examination of horizontal information sharing among tribes and vertical information sharing between tribes and others sovereigns in the American polity as possible solutions to the problems created by information asymmetry. These strategic responses are embodied in two information systems, the Tribal Financial Information Clearinghouse and an Intergovernmental Tracking System for sharing law enforcement data. We conclude with a discussion of how our typology can be more generally applied to other instances of information asymmetry.},

After a description of the theoretical status and social relevance of rural discourse, three such discourses, drawn from current debates on the future of Dutch countryside are analysed. The agri-ruralist, utilitarian and hedonist discourses distinguished here clearly differ in their perceptions of the main problems in rural areas, the best solutions and the social actors identified to bring about the ‘ideal countryside’. The analysis of rural discourses thus provides an adequate framework for interpreting the multiplicity of ‘visions’ and policy concepts applied in the debates on the countryside in Europe.},

The inclusion of multiple stakeholders and sources of information is expected to solve such problems. Prior research has highlighted the importance of collaborative process characteristics in reaching agreements and building social capital, but less is known about what factors affect the implementation of such agreements. A parallel stream of research in policy implementation theory has developed variables and frameworks to explain the implementation of authoritative policy prescriptions. Drawing on the top-down/bottom-up perspectives on implementation, this study examines implementation of collaborative recommendations along a continuum of top-down/bottom-up approaches. A comparison of six cases in two states (Lower Saxony, Germany and Ohio, United States) indicates important differences in perceptions of implementation and environmental improvements, although whether an effort was more top down or more bottom up was not a key determinant of results. In both states, stakeholder collaborative planning efforts included substantial involvement from stakeholders and multiple government agencies and levels. Participants in the Ohio cases perceived higher levels of implementation and environmental improvements. Key factors promoting implementation of plan recommendations were resources (funding and a full-time coordinator), willing land owners, and networks. In the Lower Saxony cases, collaborative plans were seen as less impactful, but nevertheless the process of plan development did foster networks for implementing some actions to improve water quality.},

	shorttitle = {Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty},
	abstract = {This open access book focuses on both the theory and practice associated with the tools and approaches for decisionmaking in the face of deep uncertainty. It explores approaches and tools supporting the design of strategic plans under deep uncertainty, and their testing in the real world, including barriers and enablers for their use in practice. The book broadens traditional approaches and tools to include the analysis of actors and networks related to the problem at hand. It also shows how lessons learned in the application process can be used to improve the approaches and tools used in the design process. The book offers guidance in identifying and applying appropriate approaches and tools to design plans, as well as advice on implementing these plans in the real world. For decisionmakers and practitioners, the book includes realistic examples and practical guidelines that should help them understand what decisionmaking under deep uncertainty is and how it may be of assistance to them. Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty: From Theory to Practice is divided into four parts. Part I presents five approaches for designing strategic plans under deep uncertainty: Robust Decision Making, Dynamic Adaptive Planning, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways, Info-Gap Decision Theory, and Engineering Options Analysis. Each approach is worked out in terms of its theoretical foundations, methodological steps to follow when using the approach, latest methodological insights, and challenges for improvement. In Part {II}, applications of each of these approaches are presented. Based on recent case studies, the practical implications of applying each approach are discussed in depth. Part {III} focuses on using the approaches and tools in real-world contexts, based on insights from real-world cases. Part {IV} contains conclusions and a synthesis of the lessons that can be drawn for designing, applying, and implementing strategic plans under deep uncertainty, as well as recommendations for future work.The publication of this book has been funded by the Radboud University, the {RAND} Corporation, Delft University of Technology, and Deltares.},

	abstract = {Globally, the pressures of expanding populations, climate change, and increased energy demands are motivating significant investments in re-operationalizing existing reservoirs or designing operating policies for new ones. These challenges require an understanding of the tradeoffs that emerge across the complex suite of multi-sector demands in river basin systems. This study benchmarks our current capabilities to use Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search ({EMODPS}), a decision analytic framework in which reservoirs’ candidate operating policies are represented using parameterized global approximators (e.g., radial basis functions) then those parameterized functions are optimized using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to discover the Pareto approximate operating policies. We contribute a comprehensive diagnostic assessment of modern {MOEAs}’ abilities to support {EMODPS} using the Conowingo reservoir in the Lower Susquehanna River Basin, Pennsylvania, {USA}. Our diagnostic results highlight that {EMODPS} can be very challenging for some modern {MOEAs} and that epsilon dominance, time-continuation, and auto-adaptive search are helpful for attaining high levels of performance. The ϵ-{MOEA}, the auto-adaptive Borg {MOEA}, and ϵ-{NSGAII} all yielded superior results for the six-objective Lower Susquehanna benchmarking test case. The top algorithms show low sensitivity to different {MOEA} parameterization choices and high algorithmic reliability in attaining consistent results for different random {MOEA} trials. Overall, {EMODPS} poses a promising method for discovering key reservoir management tradeoffs; however algorithmic choice remains a key concern for problems of increasing complexity.},

	abstract = {Scenarios provide a commonly used and intuitively appealing means to communicate and characterize uncertainty in many decision support applications, but can fall short of their potential especially when used in broad public debates among participants with diverse interests and values. This paper describes a new approach to participatory, computer-assisted scenario development that we call scenario discovery, which aims to address these challenges. The approach defines scenarios as a set of plausible future states of the world that represent vulnerabilities of proposed policies, that is, cases where a policy fails to meet its performance goals. Scenario discovery characterizes such sets by helping users to apply statistical or data-mining algorithms to databases of simulation-model-generated results in order to identify easy-to-interpret combinations of uncertain model input parameters that are highly predictive of these policy-relevant cases. The approach has already proved successful in several high impact policy studies. This paper systematically describes the scenario discovery concept and its implementation, presents statistical tests to evaluate the resulting scenarios, and demonstrates the approach on an example policy problem involving the efficacy of a proposed U.S. renewable energy standard. The paper also describes how scenario discovery appears to address several outstanding challenges faced when applying traditional scenario approaches in contentious public debates.},

	shorttitle = {Collaborative Modelling in Water Resources Management},
	abstract = {Water Resources Management ({WRM}) problems are now recognised for their complexity. Approaches for dealing with these problems must integrate a variety of interests, perspectives, values and knowledge into their potential solutions. They must also confront and manage problem uncertainties. The involvement of stakeholders in these approaches is critical. Collaborative Modelling ({CM}) offers a particularly promising set of approaches to involve stakeholders in computer-based modelling activities in {WRM}. This thesis analyses two of these approaches from the Netherlands: the development of the {AZURE} {iMOD} groundwater model using a Consortium Modelling approach, and the Model-Supported Collaborative Planning approach adopted during the Dutch Delta Programme Rivers ({DPR}). It identifies which characteristics, structures, and processes of collaboration were important in achieving approach objectives, in addition to establishing those the stakeholders involved most valued and appreciated. Consortium Modelling is found to apply most in problem contexts where the scientific knowledge base is uncertain. The approach is premised upon cooperative stakeholder involvement at a high co-decision making level of participation. It is an intensive process of model co-construction, where specialists with sufficient technical knowledge collaborate in the development of a sophisticated groundwater model. In contrast, Model-Supported Collaborative Planning is more suited to problem contexts where different values and opinions proliferate and the scientific knowledge base is largely certain or uncontested. This approach directly supports policy-making, and relies upon highly structured involvement for large numbers of stakeholders at different levels of participation. It involves the development and use of a Blokkendoos model (or ‘Planning Kit’) to formulate an integrated flood protection strategy. The thesis demonstrates which stakeholders to involve and when to involve them in these approaches depends upon the problem context and the specific purposes of the {CM} exercise. Higher levels of participation are generally preferred over lower levels for both approaches, and it is broadly beneficial if stakeholders are involved during the earliest agenda setting phases. Neutral expert advice and process management can also be of benefit, provided these experts enjoy the trust of the stakeholders involved. It is also essential to confront any uncertainties with stakeholders, and provide sufficient time for both collaborative and model-construction processes to occur. This, notwithstanding, care must be taken in translating either of these approaches to cultural contexts significantly different to that existing in the Netherlands. The thesis confirms and reiterates many {CM} recommendations presented in previous research, however, several of these are found to also be dependent upon problem contexts and the specific purposes of the exercise.},

We thus explore whether a composite indicator can be built to tell ‘more than one story’ and test this in practical contexts. These include measures used in convergence analysis in the field of cohesion policies and a recent case involving the World Bank’s Doing Business Index.

	abstract = {Emerging water scarcity concerns in many urban regions are associated with several deeply uncertain factors, including rapid population growth, limited coordination across adjacent municipalities and the increasing risks for sustained regional droughts. Managing these uncertainties will require that regional water utilities identify coordinated, scarcity-mitigating strategies that trigger the appropriate actions needed to avoid water shortages and financial instabilities. This research focuses on the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, seeking to engage the water utilities within Raleigh, Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill in cooperative and robust regional water portfolio planning. Prior analysis of this region through the year 2025 has identified significant regional vulnerabilities to volumetric shortfalls and financial losses. Moreover, efforts to maximize the individual robustness of any of the mentioned utilities also have the potential to strongly degrade the robustness of the others. This research advances a multi-stakeholder Many-Objective Robust Decision Making ({MORDM}) framework to better account for deeply uncertain factors when identifying cooperative drought management strategies. Our results show that appropriately designing adaptive risk-of-failure action triggers required stressing them with a comprehensive sample of deeply uncertain factors in the computational search phase of {MORDM}. Search under the new ensemble of states-of-the-world is shown to fundamentally change perceived performance tradeoffs and substantially improve the robustness of individual utilities as well as the overall region to water scarcity. Search under deep uncertainty enhanced the discovery of how cooperative water transfers, financial risk mitigation tools, and coordinated regional demand management must be employed jointly to improve regional robustness and decrease robustness conflicts between the utilities. Insights from this work have general merit for regions where adjacent municipalities can benefit from cooperative regional water portfolio planning.},

However, variance-based {GSA} is highly computationally expensive. While different screening methods can estimate {GSA} results, these techniques typically impose restrictions on sampling methods and input types. As an alternative, this work evaluates two decision tree-based methods to approximate {GSA} results: random forests, and Extra-Trees. These techniques are applicable with common sampling methods, and continuous or categorical inputs. The tree-based methods are compared to reference Sobol {GSA} and Morris screening techniques, for three cases: an Ishigami-Homma function, a H1N1 pandemic model, and the {CDICE} integrated assessment model. The Extra-Trees algorithm performs favorably compared to Morris elementary effects, accurately approximating the relative importance of Sobol total effect indices. Furthermore, Extra-Trees can estimate variable interaction importances using a pairwise permutation measure. As such, this approach could offer a user-friendly option for screening in models with inputs of mixed types.},

Traditional {MORDM} first optimized a problem under a baseline scenario, then evaluated candidate solutions under an ensemble of uncertain conditions, and finally discovered scenarios under which solutions are vulnerable. In this analysis, we perform multiple multi-objective search trials that directly incorporate these discovered scenarios within the search. Through the analysis, we have created multiple problem formulations to show how methodological choices of severe scenarios affect the resulting candidate planning solutions.

	abstract = {Policy analysts love solving complex problems. Their favorite problems are not just technically complex but also characterized by the presence of many different social actors that hold conflicting interests, objectives, and perceptions and act strategically to get the best out of a problem situation. This book offers guidance for policy analysts who want to assess if and how their analysis could be of help, based on the premise that problem formulation is the cornerstone in addressing complex problems. This book positions policy analysis within the theories on processes of policy making, and focuses on methods and techniques for structuring complex problems. The book takes a systems perspective as its basis, complemented by techniques for analyzing multi-actor systems, and for dealing with an uncertain future. Analytical results are then interpreted and used for problem formulation. In the last part of the book, the resulting problem formulation is used to diagnose meaningful follow-up activities, including potential in-depth policy analysis research. This book is firmly embedded in problem structuring theory, but also shows the tricks of the trade, the assumptions underlying practice, the choices that need to be made, and the dilemmas encountered by the analyst. The authors are involved in teaching problem structuring methods and policy analysis at the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management of Delft University of Technology. Their interdisciplinary approach to problem formulation reflects their multi-disciplinary backgrounds, which range from physics, informatics and land-use planning to public administration and the philosophy of technology.

	abstract = {Long-term investments challenge decision makers to look into the far future. Existing future studies often build upon a rational idea of decision making that does not help to explain why decision makers anticipate the future. In addition, existing studies do not provide a clear definition of what is considered as “forward looking”. This article proposes a framework that can be used to evaluate and explain for what reasons and based on what criteria decision makers take forward-looking investment decisions. We apply this framework to a specific decision-making case about a Dutch sea lock, making use of interviews (n = 16) and a content analysis of primary documents (n = 430). We find that not all investment decisions are necessarily forward looking. Secondly, we conclude from our case that decisions became forward looking because administrators used scenarios, visions, and flexible solutions to build support, avoid political risks and comply to formal rules. Scenario developers and urban planners could therefore involve administrators in early stages of the decision-making process to increase their awareness of the future towards which they are steering and provide them with alternative future paths. Furthermore, they could identify and use relevant institutional rules with forward-looking features to stimulate forward-looking decisions.},

	title = {Learning an Opponent’s Preferences to Make Effective Multi-Issue Negotiation Trade-Offs},
	abstract = {Software agents that autonomously act and interact to achieve their design objectives are increasingly being developed for a range of e-commerce applications. In this context, automated negotiation is a central concern since it is the de facto means of establishing contracts for goods or services between the agents. Now, in many cases these contracts consist of multiple issues (e.g. price, time of delivery, quantity, quality) which makes the negotiation more complex than when dealing with just price. In particular, eﬀective and eﬃcient multi-issue negotiation requires an agent to have some indication of its opponent’s preferences over these issues. However, in competitive domains, such as e-commerce, an agent will not reveal this information and so the best that can be achieved is to learn some approximation of it through the negotiation exchanges. To this end, we explore and evaluate the use of kernel density estimation for this purpose. Speciﬁcally, we couch our work in the context of making negotiation trade-oﬀs and show how our approach can make the negotiation outcome more eﬃcient for both participants.},

	abstract = {A new paradigm for planning under conditions of deep uncertainty has emerged in the literature. According to this paradigm, a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions, and establish a framework to guide future actions. A plan that embodies these ideas allows for its dynamic adaptation over time to meet changing circumstances. We propose a method for decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes called ‘Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways’. We base our approach on two complementary approaches for designing adaptive plans: ‘Adaptive Policymaking’ and ‘Adaptation Pathways’. Adaptive Policymaking is a theoretical approach describing a planning process with different types of actions (e.g. ‘mitigating actions’ and ‘hedging actions’) and signposts to monitor to see if adaptation is needed. In contrast, Adaptation Pathways provides an analytical approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible actions based on alternative external developments over time. We illustrate the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach by producing an adaptive plan for long-term water management of the Rhine Delta in the Netherlands that takes into account the deep uncertainties about the future arising from social, political, technological, economic, and climate changes. The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further test and use the approach.},
