\section{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{a:sensitivity-analysis}

The sensitivity analysis was carried out by performing a feature scoring analysis. Feature scoring was chosen, as also described in section \ref{ss:sensitivity-analysis}, because while still using the SOBOL sampling method, it has lower computational requirements \cite{jaxa-rozen_tree-based_2018}. The results from this can be seen in the figures below.
