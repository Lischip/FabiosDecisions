\section{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{a:sensitivity-analysis}

The sensitivity analysis was carried out by performing a feature scoring analysis. Feature scoring was chosen, as also described in section \ref{ss:sensitivity-analysis}, because while still using the SOBOL sampling method, it has lower computational requirements \cite{jaxa-rozen_tree-based_2018}. The results from this can be seen in figures \ref{fig:feat-scor-g-wo} - \ref{fig:feat-scor-o-wo} (sensitivity analysis without policies) and figures  \ref{fig:feat-scor-g} - \ref{fig:feat-scor-o} (sensitivity analysis with policies) below.
