\section{Approach}
\label{s:approach}
%Approach; What selection of deep uncertainty methods are you using, in what order, and why? This should be clearly motivated and grounded in the literature

% Analysis is carried out across the explicated rival problem framings and relies on state-of- the-art deep uncertainty techniques


%In what order are we using the tools and why are we using them this way
We employed TU Delft's open source EMA workbench library which allows for simulations, visualisation and analysis in Python \parencite{kwakkel_exploratory_2017}. An adapted version of the model presented in \citetitle{ciullo_accounting_2019} was used to discover possible strategies.




NSGAII-Epsilon - most it can handle is 7-8 objectives. Therefore, the objectives were prioritised.
%Z: to be fair, this is probably also easiest to communicate to the client, lol

Scenario discovery (PRIM)

Directed search(MOEA, MORDM, multi-scenario MORDM, MOE, may need scen disco) $\xrightarrow{}$ sensitivity analysis $\xrightarrow{}$ Test on found scenarios

%Tools used are unique from policy presentation - you can use MORDM and do policy pathways - CITE: Kwakkel, Haasnoot and Walker, 2015
