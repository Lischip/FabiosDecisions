\section{Results}
\label{s:results}
%Results; this should be a readable summary of the results from applying the approach. Donâ€™t pursue death by figures but carefully select what visualizations (figures, tables) are functional for telling your story and logically lead to the main conclusions and policy advice?

% Convincing story, consistent with approach using carefully designed visuals and tables to support narrative

\subsubsection{Scenario Generation}
\subsubsection{Scenario Discovery}
\subsubsection{Scenario Selection}
%We have all the uncertainties - in ranges - for each actor, and for each objective (because PRIM is objective based). Put these all in a table or figure. Then can say these uncertainties are important for this actor, this actor, this actor, these objectives etc. Hopefully, uncertainties from Gelderland will also pop-up, which will tell us about uncertainties in Gelderland.
