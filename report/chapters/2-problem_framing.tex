\section{Problem Framing}
\label{s:prob_frame}
% Problem framing; the decision problem can be structured in many ways. 
% Our problem owner is Gorssel
%How are you framing the problem? 
farms> cities

%What do you see as the key objectives and constraints? 
obj: 
- Same level of protection for people as the city
- balance flood risk and loss of profits from land encroachment

cons: 
- Not all land can be encroached --> farmers >:( 
-

%What levers are relevant, and what is being treated as uncertain. 

%It is important to show an awareness of the political arena within which your problem owner is operating. It is also possible to entertain more than one problem formulation.

% Explicit framing of problem from multiple relevant perspective (i.e. rival framings)
% Rival framings considered include Overijssel and Environmental Groups, as these were seen as being the most consequential to our group.
