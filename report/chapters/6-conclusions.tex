In this report we have applied state of the art decision-making under deep uncertainty approaches to identify robust and cost effective policy alternatives for flood risk management in the Municipality of Gorssel. Multi-scenario MORDM was employed to generate a large range of scenari

\subsection{Final Policy Recommendation for Gorssel}

\subsection{Next Steps}
Based on these results, and the points of discussion raised in Section \ref{s:discussion}, we strongly recommend re-visiting the problem formulations following policy discussions/negotiations with both Deventer and Overijssel.

\subsubsection{Pursuing Dike Policy}
Following this re-evaluation, should Gorssel still wish to pursue local dike expansion options, there are two key recommendations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Gorssel (or the Province of Overijssel) should seek additional expert advice/testing to reduce uncertainty regarding the probability of failure of dikes in both Gorssel and Deventer.
    \item Any dike expansions should be accompanied by a dike strength monitoring and evaluation program to manage risks of failure, and to ensure preventative actions can be taken to further fortify or repair identified weaknesses.
\end{enumerate}
